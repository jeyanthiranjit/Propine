It is a Selenium / TestNG java class test script.
We can run it through Jenkins - run.bat
Or I can create in Javascript / Mocha if you are looking for Unit testing
I have included a text file for my findings for 1A & 1B
the improvements are - we can include negative sceraios for 1A - like whicha re possible ways the user enter wrong data and are we giving them exactly suitable error.
Also we can include the correct format while showing "Invalid date" text.

Thanks for this opportunity and your time.

Updated: the correct batch file is updated - test.bat
